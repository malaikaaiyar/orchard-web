    <h1 id="orchard-title">`about`</h1>
    <p>
        we started [orchard] to create a dedicated place for people to pursue their passion projects, to do something for themselves, away from their obligations. historically, great creative work across disciplines happened in small, experimental, thriving communities like [orchard]. the spirit of making, seeing people do work they believe in: it's special!
    </p>

    <p>
        participants have said that they would tell their friends [orchard] is a place with good vibes, a community worth growing with, casual and inspiring demos, and great tea.
    </p>

    <p>
      [orchard] follows the format of <a href="https://www.socratica.info/">socratica</a>, a community of makers and thinkers that has been running for years in cities around the world. we often host joint sessions with the nodes in <a href="https://lu.ma/craft_">London</a> and <a href="https://lu.ma/scaledown">Cambridge</a>.

    <h2>what to make?</h2>

    <p>
        your project can be something you've been wanting to do, something you might fail at, something you loveâ€¦ as long as it makes you feel alive! we encourage you to do something you can grow over a long time, feel proud of, and present at the end.
